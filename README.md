# Visual Studio Reference Report

Very simple Console application, but very handy if you need to find out what assemblies/dlls you projects depend on.

- Searches for VB.Net and C# project files under a directory
- Pulls out the references (excluding project references)
- Saves them to a CSV File

## Running the application

Pass the directory you want to search as the first (and only) console argument.
